Hey! I'm legacv, a student at Purdue University studying cybersecurity & network engineering technology.

This blog is a work-in-progress, please excuse the mess. It'll be meant to host my blog posts and act as a portfolio for what I've done as an undergraduate (& beyond?)

My interests lie in penetration testing; more specifically, web applications. I've got my eJPT certification, as well as my Security+. In the past, I've worked on the InfoSec team of a medium-size organization doing application security testing, some security automation & process streamlining, phishing metric analysis, & various other projects. This summer, I'll be on the InfoSec team of a different, much larger organization, working with their red team on... I'm not quite sure yet.

As an undergraduate, the research I've done has mostly consisted of literature reviews. I've co-authored a paper on GSM cracking; made a strain of ransomware; analyzed BlueKeep, EternalBlue, and DirtyCOW; and written about the application of Merton and Agnew's Strain Theories on The Shadow Brokers and their data theft. Currently, I'm working on a paper about the vulnerabilities that rehosting (or lift-and-shift) introduces into a company's cloud environment. 

I also run a homelab, this blog, and do various CTFs. My team placed 5th in the fall 2024 experienced bracket of NCL and 8th in CyberSEED 2025.

Happy to provide a resume on request, though it may not be as up-to-date as this blog. Email me at legacv@proton.me or DM me on Mastodon at legacv@infosec.exhange. I'm also @legacv on HackTheBox, TryHackMe, picoCTF, NCL...
