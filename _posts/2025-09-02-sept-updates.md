title:  "Independent Studying"

Long time, no see. I was busy with the 9-5 & exploring the wonderful city of Chicago. But now I'm back at Purdue for my last semester and I'm buckled in, hopefully.

On top of my capstones, a new TA position, and a grad class on IoT, I made myself an independent study to address the gaps in my web application testing knowledge. The gist of it is this: I do most of the PortSwigger web application testing labs while reading along in Vickie Li's Bug Bounty Bootcamp; I learn basic AD exploitation and pivoting through a couple chapters in 2 select books in time for CPTC; I take a break from labs while learning about risk through How To Measure Anything In Cybersecurity Risk; and I close out with some high-stakes (not really) malware analysis labs from Honig and Sikorski's Practical Malware Analysis. I even made myself a syllabus and everything.

Keen-eyed website crawlers might realize that this website's URL has changed from legacv.github.io to legacv.me, and that's because I scored a free student domain from Namecheap. Had to pay for the SSL certificate, though. Losers. Anyway, it's behind Cloudflare, too, because it was (unfortunately) the easiest and cheapest option.

I'm hoping to note-take the wondrous things I learn from my independent study and host them on the subdomain docs.legacv.me. I'll figure that out at some point. The way I note-take is generally not easily usable by people who aren't me, and is more a device for my memory and quick reference later, but it might help somebody -- especially when I start posting commands and scripts.

Closing thought: I'm excited for my IoT class, because it's really free-rein, and I'll get to do some more research this semester. No matter how harrowing my experience was with my cloud paper, I still enjoy it. Be on the lookout for another legacv paper.
