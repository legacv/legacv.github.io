title:  "GSM Cracking"
published: true

I took a course on the fundamentals of cryptography, and our final was a group paper on... anything relating to cryptography. We chose the methodology of cracking Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) traffic using rainbow tables.

[The paper][paper] might take the cake for most rushed undergraduate paper in existence. There were many cooks in the kitchen. It's been so long that I couldn't confidently tell you its quality. Take a read if that interests you.

Please see [my recent cloud paper][cloud] for a more accurate representation of my work.
