I've been in college 3 years now -- next semester is my last one on-campus. I'd like to compile, for better or for worse, some stories from our (allegedly) grueling network curriculum.

1. No More Google
    Our networking labs make us configure... well... networks, from scratch. Routing, switching, all that jazz. Testing Internet connectivity is, of course, a must. `ping 8.8.8.8` should do the trick, yeah? Just don't send too many packets, and... oh, you left it running for a month? Congrats, you're blocked by Google's DNS. All of us are blocked by Google's DNS. We've had to do `ping 1.1.1.1` for as long as I can remember, because somebody got us ICMP blocked by Google.

2. Happy(?) Birthday
    Our labs are graded in two parts: reports and check-offs. For check-off, a lab TA will come around and ask you to demonstrate the intended functionality of your created network, so everything should be working by check-off day. This leads to many, many long nights -- latest I've stayed is 3 in the morning, but people can (and do) sleep in the lab.

    Well, it was a friend of mine's birthday the day before check-off. It was the afternoon, no labs were scheduled so a handful of us were in the lab room puttering around. We start chatting, he tells us (me & my lab partner) it's his 21st and he's off to have a couple drinks with his family -- and come back to keep working. Brave, but sacrifices must be made.

    It's the evening, we're still in there. He comes back -- stumbling. While I'm waiting on my partner to come back from the bathroom, I get to watch this guy attempt to walk down the hallway and shoulder-check himself against the wall at least twice. My partner emerges from the bathroom, asks the guy how he's doing, he tells us he was just in the bathroom. Note, my partner was just in the bathroom. He didn't see or hear him in there. 

    Not the end of the story, dear reader. We're still not done, but our brains are fried, we call it a night. Wake up early-ish the next morning, in the lab room by maybe 8, 9. We walk into the datacenter -- who do we see but our dear friend, eyes bloodshot, plugging something into a patch panel.

    He'd been there all night. He's still not done. Legend has it he's still working on that lab...
    
3. No laptop 4 u
    When they can't suspend you, they take your laptop away. A person in our curriculum had their laptop privileges revoked after repeated bad behavior. After that, I watched them take notes with a Bluetooth keyboard they hooked up to their phone. I respect the commitment to being studious, but I would've just brought a notebook...
