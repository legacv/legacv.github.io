Hi! It's legacv. It's mid-late June of 2025 and Purdue Hackers has just put out their latest baby, SIGHORSE, or Special Interest Group in Horsing Around. You can read more about it [here][sighorse], but the goal is simple: make whatever you want, but make something.

I had a few options to join:
- A bookkeeping tool for pentests, because my note-taking is not up to par;
- A website (the one you're looking at) -- making it more usable (on my side) and understanding Jekyll;
- Reading through [Practical Malware Analysis][pma] by Michael Sikorski and Andrew Honig and doing the labs;
- Modeling an ICS environment to learn about modbus, HMIs, PLCs, and how to pentest them

The last option was, naturally, the most appealing for this SIG. Problem is I know nothing about ICS, and my soft hands have never worked in a factory, warehouse, or power plant. I'll be making a series of blog posts documenting my journey, this being the first; up next should be a document on how I found all my resources, including papers, software, and hardware.

If you know anything about ICS security (at all), please feel free to shoot me a PM on Mastodon -- legacv@infosec.exchange.

Go join SIGHORSE! Have some fun!
