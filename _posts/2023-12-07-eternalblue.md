title:  "EternalBlue, BlueKeep, and DirtyCOW"
published: true

Around the end of 2023, I was tasked with writing a paper on any topic we'd covered in a course I was taking at the time. I chose to explore some of the most famous Windows exploits (the Eternal suite) & how EternalBlue* was used in the WannaCry ransomware attack, as well as BlueKeep and DirtyCOW.

[The paper][paper] doesn't necessarily present any new ideas, being more of a "literature review" than anything else -- it was more for me & the course than for academia at large. Feel free to have a read if it interests you.

*I didn't know it at the time, but I'd go on to write about the Shadow Brokers (who leaked EternalBlue) [again][again].
