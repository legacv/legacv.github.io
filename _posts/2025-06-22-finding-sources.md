title:  "Finding Sources"

Hi! It's still mid-late June. I'm finding sources for my [ICS pentesting project for SIGHORSE][sighorse]. I need, or would like:

###### Documentation:
- Documentation on how ICS networks are normally built (let's say a coal power plant)
- What the different protocols typically in use are for ICS systems
###### Software:
- Virtualization software (QEMU, Proxmox, ESXi)
- Windows ISO
- Linux* ISO (Ubuntu? FreeBSD?)
- Virtualized switches
- Virtualized routers
- **PLC emulation**
- **SamuraiSTFU**
- A... physics simulator?
###### Hardware:
- A server to run all the virtual stuff on
- A monitor, keyboard and mouse (can't forget the simple stuff)
- A separate laptop to go on the offense
- A physical PLC, if I'm lucky
