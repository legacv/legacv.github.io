title:  "Ransomware Creation"
published: true
---

In contrast to other papers I've posted on here, this one documents the creation of a tangible product. For a C coding class, I and two peers made a strain of ransomware! Taking reference from the wonderful [vx-underground][vx] and [crow][crow], we learned the basics of the Win32 API, OpenSSL, and malware/ransomware in general.

[The paper][paper] is the surviving artifact of the project, as the repository & demo video for the project are private. I mostly worked on the filesystem spidering and encryption functionality, while my peers worked on process injection & AV/Windows Defender avoidance. Have a read! I had tons of fun.
